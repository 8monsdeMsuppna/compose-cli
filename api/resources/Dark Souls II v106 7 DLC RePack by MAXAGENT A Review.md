Dark Souls II is not a direct sequel to the first Dark Souls game, but rather a spiritual successor that shares some elements and themes. The game has a new protagonist, a cursed undead who seeks to break the cycle of death and rebirth by finding a cure for his or her affliction. The game also has a new director, Tomohiro Shibuya, who took over from Hidetaka Miyazaki, the creator of the series.
 
Dark Souls II is known for its high level of difficulty and unforgiving gameplay. The game does not hold the player's hand or explain everything clearly. The player has to learn from trial and error, and from exploring the environment and reading item descriptions. The game also has a unique mechanic called hollowing, which reduces the player's maximum health every time he or she dies, unless the player uses a rare item called a human effigy to restore his or her humanity. The game also has a dynamic lighting system that affects the visibility and atmosphere of the game world.
 
Dark Souls II received critical acclaim from critics and fans alike, who praised its gameplay, graphics, sound, story, and online features. The game also won several awards, including the Golden Joystick Award for Game of the Year in 2014. The game sold over 2.5 million copies worldwide as of April 2015. The game also spawned two more games in the series, Dark Souls III and Dark Souls Remastered, as well as a spin-off game called Bloodborne.
